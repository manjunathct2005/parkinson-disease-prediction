ðŸ§  Parkinson's Disease Prediction â€“ Machine Learning Project
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease, a chronic and progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement and speech. Early diagnosis is essential for timely treatment and improving the quality of life. We use machine learning models trained on biomedical voice measurements to classify whether a patient has Parkinsonâ€™s disease.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
We use the Parkinsonâ€™s Telemonitoring Voice Dataset which includes features like:

Fundamental frequency (average, maximum, minimum)

Jitter, shimmer (variations in speech signal)

Harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR)

Dynamical features extracted from voice recordings

You can find the dataset on:
ðŸ”— UCI Parkinsonâ€™s Dataset

ðŸ¤– ML Models Used
Logistic Regression

Random Forest

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

XGBoost
